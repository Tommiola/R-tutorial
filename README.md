# R-tutorial

This repository includes the R scripts originally developed for a course in Research Methods and Statistics at Newcastle University. 

There are 3 scripts and two datasets. 

1. R-introduction: this script introduces the reader to the R language and the Rstudio application. It shows the main concepts to get started, data wrangling and reshaping, and some plotting with GGPLOT2
2. R-regression: the script introduces to simple and multiple regression with some model plotting.
3. R-PCA_EFA: this tutorial is on the application of Principal Component Analysis and Exploratory Factor analysis.
